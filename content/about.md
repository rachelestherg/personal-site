Hi! I'm Rachel, it's nice to meet you :)

I currently am a middle and high school computer science teacher who is passionate about helping my students gain a lifelong interest in programming. In addition to teaching, I enjoy tutoring those that may not have access to a computer science class. When beginning to program, it is important to have someone who will help guide you, avoid burn-out, and point out gaps in understanding. At the moment, I am offering tutoring services to those of high school age, as well as adults. 

My interest in teaching began in college. I had the opportunity to work as a Teaching Assistant for a few computer science courses. I found that I loved working one-on-one with students who needed extra help with programming fundamentals. After graduating with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics, I went into software engineering. Although it was interesting work, I felt that I was missing something that was very important to me - fulfillment. I looked back on how I really enjoyed my time as a TA, and decided to pivot my career path and pursue teaching.

Whether you are just about to take your first programming class, or just want to learn how to program for fun, I would love to help you. I am currently only offering individual online tutoring over zoom.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
