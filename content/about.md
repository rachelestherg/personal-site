Hi there - I'm Rachel! 

I'm a Computer Science teacher who introduces Python to high school students. Prior to teaching, I worked as a software engineer for a multi-national corporation.  

I graduated in 2018 from UNC-Chapel Hill with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. While at Carolina, I worked as an undergraduate Teaching Assistant, teaching and tutoring introductory computer science courses. Over those two years as a TA, I worked primarily with Python. I loved working one-on-one with students who needed extra help with programming fundamentals, and I would love to help you!

Because of my Mathematics major and prior experience with tutoring Calculus, I can also help you with homework or test prep in various math courses. My tutoring offerings range from Algebra up to Calculus.

I'm here to help. Let me know what you have in mind!

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Rachel
